# Application and Workshop Fees

## Application 

**Applications to the full PoreCamp Vancouver event have now closed and the course waitlist is full.** We invite you to ([register for the day-long Highlights workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/porecamp-vancouver-one-day-highlights-session-registration-friday-may-4-tickets-43071424791)) - registration will remain open through April 13 or until all tickets have sold, whichever comes first.

## Workshop Fees
The workshop fee is $1500CAD. PoreCamp runs on a break-even basis and weâ€™ve calculated the workshop fee so as to cover our major expenses. For transparency purposes, the bulk of the workshop revenue - 60% - covers costs related to instruction (flights, accommodation, meal per diems, and a small honorarium for our instructors, all of whom are taking time away from their families and their laboratories to run the course), while 30% covers the costs of the MinION flow cells and reagents, and 10% covers hospitality expenses (the opening reception, coffee breaks, and the Aquarium sequencing field trip and closing dinner). Please note that we cannot provide tuition receipts for income tax purposes. 

Cancellations before 11:59pm on April 9 will receive a 50% refund of their workshop fee. Cancellations from April 10 onwards will forfeit the workshop fee.
