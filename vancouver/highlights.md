## PoreCamp Highlights: a Day-Long MinION Training Workshop, May 4, 2018 - Vancouver, BC

## What is PoreCamp Highlights?
Vancouver is proud to host the sixth edition of the [PoreCamp series](https://porecamp.github.io/), founded by Nick Loman, Matt Loose and Mick Watson in 2015. When we opened registration for the full, week-long PoreCamp Vancouver event in late 2017, we were overwhelmed with the nubmer of excellent applicants! To ensure as many people as possible could access the training, we decided to add a second, day-long "mini" PoreCamp. This Highlights workshop, which we recently successfully trialled at the Wellcome Genome Campus' Clinical Viral Genomics course, gets you around two-thirds of the full camp learning experience in one-fifth the time!

PoreCamp Highlights is based around Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)’s [MinION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion) sequencing system. The MinION is a USB-size DNA sequencer which is capable of producing 10-20 Gbase of sequence data with read lengths as high as a million kilobases. One of its key advantages is to produce data in near-real time - the system has been used to monitor the [Ebola outbreak](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v530/n7589/full/nature16996.html) in 2015, the [Zika outbreak](http://zibraproject.github.io/) in 2016, and in July 2016 the MinION became the [first sequencer in space](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2181.html). The Porecamp instructors recently [sequenced a whole human genome](http://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878) with this technology. 

## How does PoreCamp Highlights differ from the full camp?
The Highlights workshop includes nearly all the lecture material from Day 1 of the full camp, but in condensed form - we go through the material in a half-day, rather than a full day. Instead of spending three full days doing hands-on library prep, sequencing, and bioinformatics, Highlights workshop participants will spend a half-day observing live demos of each of the three activities, led by our expert instructors. The workshop concludes with a cocktail reception, and a chance to spend some one-on-one time asking questions of our instructional team. 

The Highlights workshop is ideal for:
* researchers not yet working with the MinION but interested in its potential
* researchers whose schedules or budgets might not permit attending the full course
* anyone who missed the application call for the full camp 

## When and where will PoreCamp Highlights take place?
The workshop will run all day Friday, May 4, 2018. We’ll be based in Room 102 (the multipurpose room) at the [Michael Smith Laboratories](http://www.msl.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
